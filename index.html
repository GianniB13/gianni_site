  My restuarant will only serve food that comes from the recipes my grandma's made. The food will be a mix of Italian and Croatian. This means I will be serving different kinds of pasta and pizza, aswell as ćevapi sanwiches and deserts such as palačinke and so on.
</p>
<p>
  <br>	
There will be some rules in my restuarant, such as: No kids menu (If kids dont like my food I don't care, I'm not making chicken nuggets). 
Another rule will be no crying babies, or babies in general, I'd rather die then listen to crying kids at work.
